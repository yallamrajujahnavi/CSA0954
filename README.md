Revision Day-4 
Course : CSA09 Programming in Java

1. Create Customer class with deposit() and withdraw() as synchronized methods. Declare 
AccountNo, AccName and Balance as Instance Variables inside the class. From the main 
class, Input the amount for withdraw() operation and if requested amount is not available in 
existing Balance amount, withdraw() method should be temporarily suspended using wait() 
method until deposit() method receives the input for amount, to be added in the existing 
Balance amount and then withdraw() would be completed in a successful manner. Develop 
the above scenario using Synchronization and Inter-Thread Communication.
Note : existing Bank balance amount 10000
Sample Input : 12000, 3000
Sample Output : Withdraw operation success, balance amount 1000
Test Cases
1. 11000, 4000
2. -10000, -2000
3. 0, 0
4. EIGHT SEVEN, FIVE
5. 100.67, 200.68
2. Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:
answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.
Example 1:
Input: n = 3
Output: ["1","2","Fizz"]
Test Case
Test 
Case
Inputs
1. n = 5
2. n = 10
3. n = 12
4. n = 18
5. n = 20
3. Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.
Symbol Value
I 1
V 5
X 10
L 50
C 100
D 500
M 1000
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written 
as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the 
numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is 
before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, 
which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:
 I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
 X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
 C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
 Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.
Example:
Input: s = "III"
Output: 3
4. Given two strings ransomNote and magazine, return true if ransomNote can be constructed

5. You are given an m x n binary matrix mat of 1's (representing soldiers) and 0's (representing 
civilians). The soldiers are positioned in front of the civilians. That is, all the 1's will appear 
to the left of all the 0's in each row.
A row i is weaker than a row j if one of the following is true:
The number of soldiers in row i is less than the number of soldiers in row j.
Both rows have the same number of soldiers and i< j. Return the indices of the k weakest 
rows in the matrix ordered from weakest to strongest.
Example 1:
Input: mat = 
[[1,1,0,0,0],
[1,1,1,1,0],
[1,0,0,0,0],
[1,1,0,0,0],
[1,1,1,1,1]], 
k = 3
Output: [2,0,3]
Explanation: 
The number of soldiers in each row is: 
- Row 0: 2 
- Row 1: 4 
- Row 2: 1 
- Row 3: 2 
- Row 4: 5 
The rows ordered from weakest to strongest are [2,0,3,1,4].
6. Given an integer num, return the number of steps to reduce it to zero. In one step, if the 
current number is even, you have to divide it by 2, otherwise, you have to subtract 1 from it.
Example 1:
Input: num = 14
Output: 6
Explanation: 
Step 1) 14 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 7. 
Step 2) 7 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 6.
Step 3) 6 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 3. 
Step 4) 3 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 2. 
Step 5) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1. 
Step 6) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.
