4. To write a java program to illustrate overriding of methods. Define a class base In the 
base class define one constructor & one for display method Inherit a class sub from class 
‘base’. Define constructor & pass argument. Get the value of one argument from the base 
class. A method for display with the same name as that of in the base class. Define the 
class override and main method in this class. Create the object of sub class & pass two 
parameter

9. You are given an m x n binary matrix mat of 1's (representing soldiers) and 0's 
(representing civilians). The soldiers are positioned in front of the civilians. That is, all 
the 1's will appear to the left of all the 0's in each row.
A row i is weaker than a row j if one of the following is true:
The number of soldiers in row i is less than the number of soldiers in row j.
Both rows have the same number of soldiers and i< j. Return the indices of the k weakest 
rows in the matrix ordered from weakest to strongest.
Example 1:
Input: mat = 
[[1,1,0,0,0],
[1,1,1,1,0],
